## My Pokemon First APP in Java

Hello, if you get to this repo, you´re in front my first steps in JAVA. For this task, I´m doing this exercise placed by Todo Code youtube channel.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain source contains:
    1- `classes` folder to handle the classes.
    2- `logic` folder for the logic in our app.
    3- `interfaces` folder to handle the interfaces in the app.
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> To customize the folder structure to a new one you think it can get better , open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Project Content

This project is going to resolve the project proposed by TodoCode youtube channel in their "Curso Programación Orientada a Objetos con Java ☕ | 2023" context.
